## Render a Colored Square (Two Triangles)

This example defines **6 vertices** to form two triangles that make up a square.  
Each vertex is assigned a **color attribute**, and the GPU interpolates these colors smoothly across the surface.  
The result is a square where colors blend seamlessly from vertex to vertex.
